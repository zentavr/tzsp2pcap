Description: TaZmen Sniffer Protocol to PCAP converter
 This is a simple utility to listen for TaZmen Sniffer Protocol (TZSP) packets and output the contents on stdout in
 pcap format. It has only been lightly tested with Mikrotik RouterOS products, and may need alterations to work with
 other devices.
